Geographically Parameterized Outdoor Routing
============================================


Simple Project Plan:1

Milestones:

0.X: Get Routing
================
0.1 get routing to work on google maps as a proof of concept
0.2 tune routing quality - get usable/reasonable results
0.3 add multipoint routing - multiple points on a path
0.4 data coverage - cover whole Switzerland or even whole Alps
0.4 tune application usability - user interface, speed, design
0.5 some field tests - create routes and test
1.0 release (<= July 11)


1.X: Hiking Organizer
=====================  
1.1 create height profile visualizer, proof of concept
1.2 create a hiking organizer, proof of concept - organize long trips in daily stages
1.3 tune application usability - user interface, speed, design
2.0 release (-> ?)


Y.X: Routing Frenzy
===================
- add color mapping on maps for simpler visual routing
- different routing characteristics (fast/slow hiker, favor hights/valleys, daytime attribues (shadow, sun), etc)
- add untraversable regions like lakes/sea steep regions or very high mountains
- make manual routing adjustments even easier
- possibility of routing from location-name to location-name (instead of lat/lng points), eg. Bern -> Sion
- fast routing entry via url: <url>/bern/sion


Y.X Feature Frenzy
==================
- suggest some circular routes with a given start==end point and a total amount of time to be spend walking
- show different possibilities to get from A->B (e.g. best 3 routes that differ from each other)


Y.X: Social Integration
=======================
- links to routes
- saveable routes
- searching routes (or "did you mean ...." style)
- comments on routes
- rating for routes
- easy widget integration into any page
- integration into facebook
- integration into hijker.org
- integration into X


Y.X Ads
=======
- analyze different possibilities for adding Ads, e.g. google ads?
- google maps layer for showing restaurants, SAC, hotels, etc on the route


Y.X Scaling Up
==============
- add support for the whole world





Current Tasks (ordered by priority)
===================================
- high scalability routing
- mutipoint routing
- create user interface concept
- load multiple data sources and merge data for Switzerland country coverage
- find out how to best visualize the routes (overlay vs. polygon)
- tune application for speed
- tune user interface
- user interface: add feedback button







Routing Problem
===============

Idea:
Find the optimal way to walk through your favorite outdoor region.
Where optimal is defined by:
 - view (relative height to surroundings)
 - elevation
 - walking distance
 - steepness




Additional Feature Ideas:
- draw a hight profile of the selected route
- suggest daily walking fragmentation of the walking path




Routing Features:
routing over a height map can be approximated by creating walking grid over the map. this grid is 
regularly spaced and rectangular. if the grid is chosen with small node distance (therefore height
resolution) the error induced by walking on a rectangular grid can be made very small.
however high resolution will also introduce a lot of problems:
- limited grid memory capacity
- slow routing speed
- limited routing memory capacity
by aiming for high grid resolution (high routing accuracy) - which we do - it's not realistic to be 
able to solve a routing problem in real-time. for testing purposes we should be able to do real-time
routing.


this is an example of a greedy and simple approach:
therefore a pre-processing step will be required in order to pre-create all routes possible and store 
the routing results into a suited data base. on a user request in real-time what has to be done is only
to load the data and display it. 

saving one route result will typically cost some bytes to kbytes. practical example, square CH:
for CH to have about 1 arc-second resolution (~100m) we need point 5000x5000 grid. worst case scenario:
save all possible routes. greedy and stupid approach: there are (5000x5000)^2 routes to be saved, each
1kBytes. This will yield about ~900 000 000 000 000 kBytes -> 9 000 000 peta bytes. too much.

so we can't save all routes, but we can save every 1000th route, this will reduce the amount of data to
tiny ~1TB (worst case), I assume the actual case to be significantly less.

this is only a greedy approach, I am sure, there are better solutions for routing on a even spaced 
rectangular grid. on possibility I thought of:
- highway hierarchies (also used in Google Maps for street routing)


concluding from this following requirements need to be met:
a) arbitrary large big routing grids (grid data >> local memory) -> grid mem scalability
b) routing algorithm needs to be able to work with limited local memory -> routing alg. mem scalability
c) routing results need to be persistable


by having these requirements in mind a possible iterative implementation could look like this:

1. iteration 
o implement the grid and routing algorithm having a) + b) in mind (so I guess an abstraction layer is 
required to detach arbitrary big data into smaller limited sized (<< local memory) data chunks.
o don't perist data for caching
o with this you should be able to create grids up to 500x500 points


2. iteration
o save all routing results to blob to the simplest db possible (why not files...)
o pre-processing possible from now on

3. iteration
o extend grid and algorithm to meet requirements a) and b)
o this iteration will be much slower but will be able to create grids >>500x500 points


4. iteration
o tune persistency layer for speed

5. iteration
o tune algorithms for speed
